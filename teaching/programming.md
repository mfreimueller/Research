[Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html)

An interesting blog post that discusses why the modern notion of learning programming (or rather anything) in X amount of time (say, a month or two) completely misses the mark. I find this interesting as a resource that I may or may not suggest to my students to instill a notion of long-time learning.

[AI Safety Cheatsheet](https://github.com/mfreimueller/ai-safety-cheatsheet)

An interesting list of links regarding AI safety. Super interesting from a philosophers and a CS pov. May be interesting in regards to discussing (and working with) AI in class.

[Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)

For people that didn't study CS (yet), this guide provides useful resources to self-study CS.

[You Want Modules, Not Microservices](https://blogs.newardassociates.com/blog/2023/you-want-modules-not-microservices.html)

A different take on microservices, that critically assesses the motivation behind using microservices.

[Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/)

Another useful resource to self-study CS, this time in a more formal and theoretical way.

[Awesome Katas](https://github.com/gamontal/awesome-katas)

An awesome list of code katas that may or may not be useful for coding exercises.

[Nand2Tetris](https://github.com/rhedshi/nand2tetris)

Another super interesting project that is useful for learning (or teaching) how to build "a general-purpose computer system and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up" [Source](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

[Discussion Seminar: Philosophy of Programming Languages](https://github.com/reflectionalist/DS-PhPL)

A great source of papers regarding the philosophy of programming languages.
