# Interesting tools I found

A list of tools that I find interesting enough to investigate further and may, or may not, use in the future.

- [basecamp](https://basecamp.com/)

A project management tool. May be useful or not, idk.

- [Pinta](https://www.pinta-project.com/)

Allegedly better than GIMP (See [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GIMP/comments/622yhx/pinta_is_1000x_better_than_gimp_for_everyday_users/)).

- [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)

A NeoVim setup that turns NeoVim into an IDE. May be interesting, or at least boost nerd stats.

- [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)

Interactive git UI for the terminal. Basically a ncurses implementation of tools like SourceTree. May be interesting to use, although modern IDEs already integrate much functionality.
