# Research

This is a public repository used for storing interesting links or papers that I wish to remember. In the past I tried to use note-taking applications, but none of those that I tried satisfied my expectations. As I basically only need a place to write down references and maybe comment on them, I chose to use a git repository for this.

Basically this is inspired by [a similar repository](https://github.com/tedneward/Research) by Ted Neward.
